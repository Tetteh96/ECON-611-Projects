    "# CHAPTER ONE\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Since its creation in 1934, the United States' Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has been one of the most frequently used measures of economic performance. The GDP counts all the products and services that a nation produces in a specific time frame. It is possible to determine whether the economy is expanding or contracting by looking at the GDP growth rate (U.S. Economic Growth 1947–2021, n.d.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The US GDP growth rate has been varying over time, according to Macrotrends. From 2020 to 2021, a growth of 8.71% brought it to 5.95%. It fell by 5.06% to -2.77% in 2020 from 2019 and was at that level in 2020. It fell by 0.65% from 2018 to 2019, reaching 2.29% in 2019. In 2018, it was 2.95%, which was an increase of 0.7% from 2017 (U.S. Real GDP Growth Rate by Year, Compared to Inflation and Unemployment, n.d.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerous variables, including inflation, unemployment rates, and governmental policies, have an impact on the GDP growth rate. The Great Depression's economic contraction of -12.9% in 1932 resulted in the largest yearly decline in GDP growth in US history (U.S. Real GDP Growth Rate by Year, Compared to Inflation and Unemployment, n.d.).\n",
    "The GDP growth rate in the United States has fluctuated over the years, but it is still one of the most important measures of economic performance. There hasn't been enough research done to completely understand the factors that affect the rate of GDP growth (economic growth) in the US. In order to determine the factors that influence the economic growth (GDP growth rate) in the US, it is necessary to look into the relationship between these factors and economic growth in the country.\n",
    "\n",
    "To this end, we have formulated null and alternative hypotheses to achieve the study's objective. By testing these hypotheses using empirical data, we hope to contribute to the understanding of the factors that influence economic growth in the United States and to inform policy decisions related to trade policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Null hypothesis($H_0$): There are no significant factors that affect economic growth in the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alternative hypothesis($H_A$): There are significant factors that affect economic growth in the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "The study also seeks to answer the following questions based on the objective of the study:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tWhat are the factors that impact economic growth in the United States?\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tTo what extent do these factors affect economic growth in the United States?"

    "# CHAPTER TWO\n",
    "\n",
    "## Literature Review\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theoretical Literature\n",
    "\n",
    "According to conventional trade theory, specialisation, investments in innovation, increased productivity, and better resource allocation are some ways that trade benefits nations (Zahonogo 2016). This is also evident in the Ricardian– Heckscher–Ohlin theoretical model (Leamer and Levinsohn 1995). International trade openness can therefore improve output since it allows nations to more effectively allocate resources based on their comparative advantages. According to the theory of international trade, trade benefits can come from a variety of fundamental factors, including differences in comparative advantage and a rise in international trade globally (Yanikkaya 2003). The idea of comparative advantage states that because countries can import goods and services rather than investing heavily in domestic production, international trade encourages countries to employ resources more effectively. This demonstrates that imports are equally crucial to economic activity as exports. In other words, imports and exports are two elements that work in tandem and are mutually dependent. As a result, each country's trade openness provides a clear indication of its participation in international trade. The value of exports and imports in relation to GDP is shown by this indicator (Yanikkaya 2003; Fetahi-Vehapi et al. 2015; Zahonogo 2016).\n",
    "\n",
    "The neoclassical growth theory, which is based on Solow's (1957) model, is one of the first ideas that can be used to explain the relationship between Trade Openness and Economic Growth. This theory makes the assumption that external technological advancement has a long-term, major impact on Economic Growth. Therefore, if trade openness fosters technical advancement, it may have a long-term effect on economic growth. The neoclassical growth theory, in general, has a significant shortcoming since it does not offer a theoretical foundation that suggests that commercial openness can foster technical advancement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Empirical Literature\n",
    "\n",
    "Kong et al. (2021) investigated the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on China's quality of economic growth and Chinese opening up between 1994 and 2018. According to the study, there is a long-term, steady correlation between opening up and the calibre of economic growth. They argued that trade openness can greatly improve the long- and short-term quality of economic growth. They also argued that the quality of economic growth could be maintained through automatic adjustment when the short-term volatility departed from the long-term equilibrium. There was significant geographical variation and non-linear threshold characteristics in the beneficial effect of trade openness on the quality of economic growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to look at the factors that contribute to economic growth, Parash (2015) used Ordinary Least Squares regressions for the years 2010, 2005, 2000, and 1995. To determine whether the patterns in the variables are consistent throughout time, it then compares them. In all historical periods examined, it was discovered that the volume of exports and the development of natural resources have a favourable effect on economic growth in developing nations. Additionally, it discovers that increased investment and a longer life expectancy had a favourable effect on economic growth, however this finding was only true for two of the three time periods. These results are in line with other studies, and several of these factors affect economic growth in both industrialised and developing nations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nguyen and Bui (2021) looked at the nonlinear relationship between trade openness and economic growth in the Asean-6 nations (Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, Philippines, and Vietnam). The fixed-effect panel threshold approach was used by the authors to estimate the research model in order to meet the predetermined research objectives. According to the study, trade openness has a nonlinear effect on economic growth and has two threshold values. The study's findings demonstrated that high levels of trade openness (beyond the threshold value) without the addition of other complementing policies do not promote high-efficiency economic growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "With data spanning the years 1993 to 2016, Raghutla (2020) examined the effect of trade openness on economic growth in a panel of five developing market economies. The empirical findings supported the long-run relationships between trade openness, economic growth, financial development, inflation, labour force, and technology based on panel estimation methods, whereas the results of long-run elasticities show that trade openness has a significant positive impact on economic growth. According to the heterogeneous panel non-causality tests, there is a short-term unidirectional causal relationship between economic growth and trade openness as well as between economic growth and financial development. There is also a bidirectional relationship between economic growth and inflation. The results indicated that in these five emerging market economies, trade openness significantly contributes to both economic development and growth."

    "# CHAPTER THREE\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "### Data and Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Data from 1970 through 2021 were used for the study. This study mainly used secondary data from the World Bank. The variables are briefly explained as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Economic growth: the annual increase or improvement in the real per capita income (real GDP per capita or output per person) in an economy. In this study, annual real GDP is the monetary value of all final goods and services at market prices in US dollars with year 2010 as the base year. This data is sourced from World Bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trade openness: Trade between two or more countries. It is measured in this study as total trade expressed as percent of GDP. This data is sourced from World Bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign Direct Investment: Foreign direct investment are the net inflows of investment to acquire a lasting management interest (10 percent or more of voting stock) in an enterprise operating in an economy other than that of the investor. It is the sum of equity capital, reinvestment of earnings, other long-term capital, and short-term capital as shown in the balance of payments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Government Spending: government final consumption expenditure formerly known as general government consumption. It includes all government current expenditures for purchases of goods and services including compensation of employees and most expenditure on national defense and security. It excludes government military expenditures that are part of government capital formation. This data is sourced from World Bank in current U.S. dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Population Growth: Annual population growth rate for year t is the exponential rate of growth of midyear population from year t-1 to t, expressed as a percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inflation: Inflation as measured by the consumer price index reflects the annual percentage change in the cost to the average consumer of acquiring a basket of goods and services that may be fixed or changed at specified intervals, such as yearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Specification\n",
    "\n",
    "The study used the OLS to estimate the impact of trade openness on economic growth. The study uses historical data from 1970-2021 (51 years) of the United States. The OLS can be used to derive unbiased and consistent estimates of parameters. The dataset was logged and difference at first levels\n",
    "\n",
    "The ordinary linear econometric model that will be used in this study is as follows: log_GDP per capita(-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$log{\\Delta}\\_GDP per capita = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 log{\\Delta}\\_FDI(NET) + \\beta_2 log{\\Delta}\\_Trade(\\% of GDP) + \\beta_3 log{\\Delta}\\_CPI\\_Inflation + \\beta_4 log{\\Delta}\\_Pop\\_growth + \\beta_5 log{\\Delta}\\_GOVT\\_EXP + \\beta_6 log{\\Delta}\\_GDP per capita(-1) + \\mu_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation, the dependent variable($log{\\Delta}\\_GDP per capita$) is economic growth (GDP per capita). $\\beta_0$ is the intercept of the equation and vectors of the equation are $\\beta_1$, $\\beta_2$, $\\beta_3$, $\\beta_4$, $\\beta_5$ and $\\beta_6$ respectively. $log{\\Delta}\\_Trade(\\% of GDP)$ denotes the trade openness, $log{\\Delta}\\_CPI\\_Inflation$ represents CPI inflation in the United States, $log{\\Delta}\\_FDI(NET)$ represents net foreign direct investment, $log{\\Delta}\\_Pop\\_growth$, represents population growth rate in United States overtime, $log{\\Delta}\\_GOVT\\_EXP$ denotes total government expenditure in the United States over the years\\ and $log{\\Delta}\\_GDP per capita(-1)$ denotes the previous year's economic growth (GDP pre capita). \n"

    "At the 10% level of significance, the variable log_FDI(NET) is found to be statistically insignificant. This implies that there is insufficient data to draw the conclusion that FDI significantly affects economic growth in the US. This is similar to the results of Nath (2009) and  Pandya and Sisombat (2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the results show that the coefficient of log_Trade (% of GDP) is statistically insignificant at the 10% level. This means 1% increase in trade openness has no significant impact on economic growth in the United States. Rodrick(2016) asserted that the relationship between standard measures of good policy(such as trade liberalisation and low inflation) and economic growth is not particularly strong, leaving extreme cases aside.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the same vein, we cannot draw the conclusion that there is a substantial relationship between CPI inflation and economic growth in the United States since the coefficient for log_CPI_Inflation is not statistically significant even at the 10% significance level. In other words, changes in the CPI inflation rate do not seem to significantly affect changes in the rate of growth in the US economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a negative coefficient of -0.0361, the variable log_Pop_growth is discovered to be statistically significant at the 1% significance level. This suggests that, in the United States, there is an inverse relationship between population growth and economic growth (see Heady & Hodge, 2009). The coefficient specifically shows that economic growth slows down by 4.3% as population growth rate rises by 1%. This might be the result of things like heightened competition for resources and employment openings, which might cause an economic slowdown. Therefore, to encourage long-term sustainable economic growth, policymakers may need to take into account measures that address population growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results indicate a significant relationship between government expenditure and economic growth. The coefficient of log_GOVT_EXP is statistically significant at the 1% level of significance. A negative coefficient of -0.4353 suggests that 1% increase in government expenditure leads to 43.53% decrease in economic growth (see Lupu et al., 2018; M.P. Sáez et al., 2017; A.G. Hasnul, 2015). This could be as a result of the fact that increased government spending frequently results in greater taxes, which could lower disposable income and investment. Additionally, government spending may crowd out private investment and reduce economic efficiency. Therefore, controlling government expenditure is important for promoting economic growth in the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the findings, previous economic growth in the United States is a substantial driver of current economic growth due to the lagged dependent variable's significant coefficient, log_GDP per capita(-1). With this, 1% increase in the previous year's economic growth increases current economic growth by 70.75%. The idea that economic growth is a path-dependent process, where previous economic outcomes and investments influence the present and future growth trajectory, is supported by this. This study suggests that while determining the direction of future economic policies and investments, investors and policymakers should consider previous trends in economic growth. Additionally, it implies that consistent economic growth is necessary for long-term economic prosperity since it paves the way for further growth and development."

    "The R-squared value is 0.758, which is the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the independent variables. In this case, the R-squared value indicates that approximately 76% of the variation in the dependent variable is explained by the independent variables. The Adjusted R-squared value is 0.723, which is similar to R-squared, but it takes into account the number of independent variables in the model. This value suggests that the model has a good fit as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The F-statistic is 21.89 with a corresponding probability (Prob(F-statistic)) of 1.76e-11, which indicates that the overall regression model is statistically significant. This means that the model is explaining a significant amount of the variance in the dependent variable, which is a good sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "The BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) value is -250.3, indicating that the model has a good fit, as a lower BIC value suggests a better model fit. The log-likelihood value is 138.75, indicating that the model explains a significant amount of variation in the data. The AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) value is -263.5, which is also a measure of the model's goodness of fit. Similar to BIC, a lower AIC value suggests a better model fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jarque-Bera value is 3.740, indicating that the residuals are approximately normally distributed. The probability value for the Jarque-Bera test (Prob(JB)) is 0.154, which is greater than the typical threshold of 0.05. This suggests that we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the residuals are normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The p-value associated with the Omnibus test (Prob(Omnibus)) indicates the probability of obtaining the observed test statistic under the null hypothesis. With the above results, a p-value of 0.089 suggests that there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis at a significance level of 0.05, thus the residuals are normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the condition number (Cond. No.) is 42.7, which is a measure of the degree of multicollinearity in the model. A high condition number suggests that there may be high levels of multicollinearity in the model. In this case, the value is relatively low, which suggests that multicollinearity is not a significant issue."

    "In this research paper, the main objective was to analyze the effects of different factors on economic growth in the United States. The study used data from 1970 to 2021 and examined the impacts of trade openness, net FDI, CPI inflation, population growth rate, and government expenditure on economic growth. The empirical results showed that unlike trade openness, previous economic growth has a positive and significant impact on current economic growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the study found that population growth rate and government expenditure have a negative impact on economic growth. This suggests that as the population growth rate increases, economic growth tends to decrease. Similarly, as government expenditure increases, economic growth tends to decrease. These findings highlight the importance of managing population growth rate and government expenditure to maintain a healthy economic growth rate. To achieve sustainable economic growth, policies that promote population control should be considered, while government expenditure should be monitored to ensure that it is targeted towards productive activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the study did not find a significant relationship between net FDI and CPI inflation with economic growth in the United States. This implies that net FDI and CPI inflation do not have a significant impact on economic growth in the country. Overall, the study provides important insights into the factors that can influence economic growth in the United States and can be useful for policymakers and researchers in the field of economics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Net FDI and CPI inflation were found not to contribute significantly to economic growth. Although there is some modicum of evidence that in the United States, net FDI and CPI inflaiton contribute to economic growth. Policy makers should focus on strategies to attract more foreign direct investment (FDI) and maintain stable inflation to further promote economic growth. By adopting these measures, the United States can enhance its economic growth and remain competitive in the global economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we recommend that policy makers continue to monitor trends in  previous period's economic growth rate, and implement policies that promote and enhance the country's economic resilience.\n",
    "\n",
    "The findings provide insights into the key drivers of economic growth in the United States, and can serve as a guide for policy makers as they strive to promote sustainable economic growth and development in the country."
