    "\n",
    "A normal distribution has a bell-shaped density curve described by its mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$. The density curve is symmetrical(skewness of 0), centered about its mean, with its spread determined by its standard deviation. Data near the mean - e.g., $\\sigma < 1$ - are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean - e.g., $\\sigma > 2$. \n",

    "A random variable $X$ which follows a normal distribution with mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$ and has this density function: \n",

The normal random variable distributed according to the standard normal distribution is called the standard normal variable and is denoted by $Z$. It represents the number of standard deviations a given point X lies from the mean of the standard normal distribution.  It is expressed as\n",
