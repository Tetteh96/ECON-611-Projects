    "Explain why it might be advantageous to create a function instead of building all commands from scratch as you create a script.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reusability: A function can be used again throughout the code once it has been defined, potentially saving time and lowering mistakes. This is particularly helpful for complicated or repetitive actions that happen repeatedly in a script.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Modularity: A function is a self-contained piece of code that carries out a single purpose. A lengthy script can be divided into more manageable sections, making it simpler to understand, maintain, and change the code over time. Also, this may make it simpler for several developers to collaborate on the same codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encapsulation: By combining several actions, inputs, and outputs into a single function, the code can be more logically ordered and easier to understand. Also, it can assist in isolating potential faults or errors, making it simpler to find and correct them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Abstraction: Functions have the ability to abstract away the specifics of a complex operation, making it simpler for other portions of the code to use the function without having to be aware of its underlying workings. This may make the code easier to read and maintain in the long run."
